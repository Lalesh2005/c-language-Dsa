Practice exam paper Major.
1.design an algorithm to check that a given number is even or odd.
Answer:-Step-by-Step Algorithm:
	1.	Start
	2.	Input: Read a number n.
	3.	Process: Check the remainder when the number is divided by 2:
	•	If n % 2 == 0:
	•	Print “The number is even”.
	•	Else:
	•	Print “The number is odd”.
	4.	End

5.Discuss the models of  file handling in c language.
1. Sequential Access Model:

Definition:
	•	In the Sequential Access Model, data is accessed in a linear order from the beginning to the end of the file.
	•	Common for text files where data is read or written from start to finish.

Operations:
	•	Reading (fscanf, fgets, getc)
	•	Writing (fprintf, fputs, putc)
	•	Files are read from the start to the end without random access.
Definition:
	•	In the Random Access Model, data can be read or written at any position in the file.
	•	Common for binary files and database systems where direct access to any byte or record is needed.

Operations:
	•	fseek() → Moves the file pointer to a specific location.
	•	ftell() → Returns the current position of the file pointer.
	•	rewind() → Moves the file pointer back to the beginning.
Mode	Description
"r"	Open for reading (file must exist).
"w"	Open for writing (creates or overwrites the file).
"a"	Open for appending (writes to the end of the file).
"r+"	Open for both reading and writing.
"w+"	Open for both writing and reading (clears the file).
"a+"	Open for both appending and reading.
