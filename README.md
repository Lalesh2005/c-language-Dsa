# c-language-Dsa
This repository contains my implementation of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. It is part of my journey to master problem-solving and low-level programming fundamentals.
📚 What’s Included
	•	🔢 Arrays and Strings
	•	🧵 Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
	•	🗃️ Stacks and Queues (including Circular Queues)
	•	🌳 Trees, Binary Search Trees
	•	🪢 Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS)
	•	📊 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, etc.)
	•	🔍 Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
	•	💡 Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming

🎯 Goals
	•	Build a strong foundation in C and DSA
	•	Practice writing clean, modular C code
	•	Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming
	•	Understand memory management and pointer manipulation

🛠 Technologies
	•	Language: C (C99 standard)
	•	Compiler: GCC / Clang
	•	Editor: VS Code / Code::Blocks / Vim

📁 Folder Structure

Each topic is organized into its own directory and includes:
	•	Source code files (.c)
	•	Header files (.h) where applicable
	•	Sample input/output (if needed)
	•	Minimal comments for clarity

🚧 Work in Progress

This project is ongoing. I’ll keep adding new problems and topics as I progress.
